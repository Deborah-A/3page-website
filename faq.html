    <h4>Where can I get ____ dataset?</h4>
    <p>Try searching or asking in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/" target="_blank">/r/datasets</a> or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/samplesize/" target="_blank">/r/SampleSize.</a></p>

    <h4>How do I make a visualization?</h4>
    <p>Don't underestimate the power of Excel, Google Docs, or Plot. A "simple" line chart (or a collection of them) can be powerful tools in conveying interesting information.
      <br>Tableau Public and StatTrends are free tools that can make some powerful visualizations.
      <br>If you're comfortable with programming, try d3.js, R with RStudio, or matplotlib with IPython Notebook.
      <br>If you're really comfortable with programming and have a sufficiently complex dataset, hacking away with a graphics library (opengl, webgl, directx, canvas, etc.) is time consuming but can yield some powerful results.</p>


    <h4>Does appearance matter?</h4>
    <p>Yes! But pretty pictures are not the aim of this subreddit. Posts should strive to present information as effectively as possible. Part of that process is visual design. Default output from Excel, R, mapping programs, etc. can be overly
      cluttered and hard to understand. Try looking at font sizes, erroneous grid lines, alignment, and aliasing. A lack of good design ultimately limits the ability of a visualization to convey information.
      <br>However, don't downvote because you think a post is ugly. If you have some design experience, please add some constructive criticism, so people know how to improve.</p>

    <h4>Shouldn't it be "data ARE beautiful"?</h4>

      <br>In modern colloquial English, "Data" is a mass noun. It has become somewhat of a synonym for "dataset", like the "dataset" behind a visualizations you enjoy here.
      <br>In the same manner, the word "money" is a collective mass of individual monetary units; however you wouldn't say "my money are in the bank", you would simply use the phrase "money is". Here is some example usage with other mass
      nouns:
      <br>Your mother's hair is foxy.
      <br>The grass is greener on your mom's side of the family.
      <br>The sand your mom stepped in is coarse, and gets everywhere.
      <br>I cooked for your mother, and your rice is in the fridge.
      <br>Data is beautiful, and those curves are delicious.
